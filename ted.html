<h1>Ted Mosby:</h1>
<h2>Theodore Evelyn Mosby is a fictional character and the protagonist in the American sitcom How I Met Your Mother, portrayed by Josh Radnor. He serves as the show's narrator from the future, voiced by Bob Saget, as he tells his children the "long version" of how he met their mother.</h2>
<h1>character overview:</h1>
<h2>Ted is the central character of the show. Born April 25, 1978, he is from Shaker Heights, Ohio(like show creator Carter Bays), a graduate of Wesleyan University (like Bays and show co-creator Craig Thomas),an Eagle Scout,and an architect. Ted continues his profession as an architect in New York City, possibly at Columbia University. After his best friend, Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), gets engaged in the pilot episode, Ted decides to try to find his soulmate. This quest informs the general direction of the show, along with Ted's relationship with Marshall, Marshall's wife Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), Ted's on/off girlfriend Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), and his other best friend Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris).</h2>
<h1>Personality:</h1>
<h2>Ted is prone to questionable (and sometimes desperate) romantic gestures; in the pilot episode, for example, he steals a blue French horn (nicknamed "The Smurf Penis")that was a topic of conversation in his first date with Robin, and then scares Robin off by telling her he is in love with her. In a similar vein, he dresses up as a "hanging chad" every year for Halloween, in the hopes of meeting "The Slutty Pumpkin‚Äù, a woman dressed as a jack-o'-lantern (complete with strategically placed holes) whom he once met at a Halloween party.(When he finally meets the woman, however, he discovers that they have no romantic chemistry whatsoever.)</h2>
